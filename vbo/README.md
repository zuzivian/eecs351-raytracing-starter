# VBObox-Lib.js library


Note that you don't really need 'VBObox' objects for any simple,
    beginner-level WebGL/OpenGL programs: if all vertices contain exactly
		the same attributes (e.g. position, color, surface normal), and use
		the same shader program (e.g. same Vertex Shader and Fragment Shader),
		then our textbook's simple 'example code' will suffice.

***BUT*** that's rare -  most genuinely useful WebGL/OpenGL programs need
		different sets of vertices with  different sets of attributes rendered
		by different shader programs.  THUS a customized VBObox object for each
		VBO/shader-program pair will help you remember and correctly implement ALL
		the WebGL/GLSL steps required for a working multi-shader, multi-VBO program.

One 'VBObox' object contains all we need for WebGL/OpenGL to render on-screen a
		set of shapes made from vertices stored in one Vertex Buffer Object (VBO),
		as drawn by calls to one 'shader program' that runs on your computer's
		Graphical Processing Unit(GPU), along with changes to values of that shader
		program's one set of 'uniform' varibles.

The 'shader program' consists of a Vertex Shader and a Fragment Shader written
		in GLSL, compiled and linked and ready to execute as a Single-Instruction,
		Multiple-Data (SIMD) parallel program executed simultaneously by multiple
		'shader units' on the GPU.  The GPU runs one 'instance' of the Vertex
		Shader for each vertex in every shape, and one 'instance' of the Fragment
		Shader for every on-screen pixel covered by any part of any drawing
		primitive defined by those vertices.

The 'VBO' consists of a 'buffer object' (a memory block reserved in the GPU),
		accessed by the shader program through its 'attribute' variables. Shader's
		'uniform' variable values also get retrieved from GPU memory, but their
		values can't be changed while the shader program runs.
		Each VBObox object stores its own 'uniform' values as vars in JavaScript;
		its 'adjust()'	function computes newly-updated values for these uniform
		vars and then transfers them to the GPU memory for use by shader program.

I have replaced'cuon-matrix' with the free, open-source 'glmatrix.js' library
    for vectors, matrices & quaternions: Google it!  This vector/matrix library
    is more complete, more widely-used, and runs faster than our textbook's
    'cuon-matrix' library.  The version I put in the 'lib' directory is simple;
    just one file.  Later versions are more complicated, multi-file affairs.
